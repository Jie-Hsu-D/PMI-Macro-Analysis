# PMI-Macro-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project analyzes five years of PMI and macroeconomic indicators to evaluate whether PMI can serve as a leading indicator for future economic performance. Time-series forecasting models including ARIMA and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing were applied to capture trends and seasonality, enabling data-driven forecasting and decision-making.
